In this chapter different solutions will be discussed to find the most optimal solution to implement in Fredericia to limit the flow and concentration variations into the WWTP.

To limit the variations into the WWTP a mechanism is needed to hold back the wastewater. This could either be done by placing valves within the channels that would be able to limit the flow through a channel and by raising or lower the valve the flow into the WWTP could be controlled. Another possibility is to store the wastewater in tanks and thereby control the output of the tank with a pump. 

By using a valve to control the flow thereby cause the sewer to be filled which correspond to using the pipe as a tank. In extreme cases, this could lead to overflow if not controlled properly thereby cause wastewater to overflow into small rivers and other safety measures. However, it would be easier to install valves throughout the sewer network in respect to dig a large hole for a tank in the city. But after a meeting with the people from BYG OG HYG \fxnote{skal lige have skrevet department istedet for byg og hyg} it was stated that it would not be possible to use the sewer as a storing device as the sewer would be filled up to rapidly.     

In this project, it is therefore decided to use a tank to limit the flow and concentration variation into the WWTP. Using a tank will remove these fluctuations, as seen in figure \ref{fig:flow_input_wwtp} for flow, and thereby having an input to the WWTP that is less disrupted by variations. The output of the tank can be controlled to achieve a desired input to the WWTP, however, the tank must be controlled in a way where overflow in the tank is not permitted. The output of the tank can either be controlled by a pump or a valve, depended on the geographical location on the tank.
