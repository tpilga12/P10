\chapter{System description}\label{se:system_description}
This section will go into details of the structure of the sewer network for which the further work of this project will be based upon.

As mentioned in section \ref{se:chemical_process} a steady flow of sewage with a fixed level of contaminants is desired such that an optimal utilization of the wastewater treatment plant can be obtained. An area of interest is Fredericia with a sizable population of approximately 40.000 people and industries where some of the largest consists of a brewery, bottling plant, refinery and a dairy plant \cite{Statistic_Denmark}. All of these industries is placed in the outskirts of the city, meaning that the wastewater discharged into the sewer goes through populated areas creating an uneven flow of sewage to the wastewater treatment plant. Two main sewer lines separates the northern and southern part of the city. To limit the project only the northern main sewer line is considered, which covers the largest part of the households and the industry located in the city. % This excludes the dairy from the scope of the project as it is located southeast from the wastewater treatment plant. 
In figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified} a simplified overview of the northern main sewer line with the various areas of population and industry in Fredericia attached to it. The placement of the sewers shown in \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified} is obtained from a Geographically Information System (GIS) map publicly available by the municipal of Fredericia \cite{GIS_kort}. The red and the green lines indicate sewers with flows of wastewater and combined wastewater and surface runoff respectively. The populated areas are indicated by two different transparent blue colors, for easier to distinguish between the different parts of the sewer network. The red transparent areas indicate small to medium sized industry. 
Only the sewer lines out of or between the separate areas are shown. Furthermore the areas connected by a red line has a separate sewer system for surface runoff, which is lead into various ponds or the sea, minimizing the load on the wastewater treatment plant.
The bottling plant, refinery and the brewery is marked by the purple, brown and black rings respectively. Several inlets for surface runoff connected directly to the main sewer line exists. The added disturbance from these inlets is neglected on the assumption that the disturbances from the connected areas will be considerable larger.

\caption{Simplified mapping of the northern part of the sewer network in Fredericia. The two blue transparent colors indicate populated areas and the red transparent area indicate industry. Red and green lines is sewers with flows of wastewater and combined wastewater and surface runoff  respectively. Bottling plant, refinery and brewery is marked by purple, brown and black circles respectively. The purple dot is a connecting point with two incoming and two outgoing sewer lines. Blue dot is a wastewater pumping station which elevates sewage such that gravity can be utilized for the remaining transport into the treatment plant. Blue rectangle marks the location of the wastewater treatment plant.
%Mapping of part of the sewer network in Fredericia. The red and green lines indicate sewers where the red sewers has flows of sewage only and the green line is combined sewage and runoff from urban surfaces. Transparent parts indicate that the area has a connected sewer grid within and the red/green lines from this grid indicates the output from this area. Two shades of transparent blue is used to illustrate sewer systems in populated areas. The red transparent areas indicate minor industry and the black, brown and purple rings is brewery, refinery and bottling plant respectively. The purple dot indicate a splitting point with two incoming and outgoing sewer pipes. The light blue dot is a sewer reservoir before wastewater is led to the wastewater treatment plant indicated by the blue rectangle.

The various enumerated parts in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified} is shown by order of attachment to the main sewer line, together with distance between each attachment, in figure \ref{fig:sewer_line_diagram}.

Furthermore the different sections consist of pipe of varying diameters as can be seen in table \ref{tab:kloak_diameter}.

Some assumptions is made to avoid complications during simulation. The negative slope of the section between connection point four and five is flipped such that no permanent storage of sewage happens. The reason for this assumption is that it will ease the computation, of the free flow in that section, if storage in the pipe sections could be disregarded during simulation. Furthermore the new slope is deemed acceptable based on the obtained slopes for the remaining pipe sections. 
For the two pipe sections between point seven and eight, where out- and input datum is unknown, are gathered in to a single pipe section. This section will be designated an inner diameter of 1200 mm as the section with the larger diameter is assumed insignificant for the free flow at the end points of the entire section.
