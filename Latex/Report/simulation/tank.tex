\section{Tank scheme}\label{sec:tank}

This section will go through the discretization of equation \ref{eq:final_pump_model} and \ref{eq:prut_i_tank_equation2}.
Discretizing equation \ref{eq:final_pump_model}, and express it as change in terms of height, the following is obtained:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:disc_tank}
\begin{array}{l}
	\frac{h(t)-h(t-\Delta t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{A} (Q_{in}(t) - u(t)\cdot \overline Q) \\
	\Updownarrow \\
	h(t) = \frac{1}{A} (Q_{in}(t) - u(t)\cdot \overline Q) \cdot \Delta t + h(t-\Delta t)	
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Some limitations are needed to be considered during implementation such that outflow can never exceed what is currently in the tank.
Solving the equation for a change in level of concentrate in the tank explicit, and discretizing it the following is obtained:
%Discretizing the equation for change in level of concentrate in the tank solving it explicit the following is obtained:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:disc_con_tank}
\begin{array}{l}
	\frac{C_{tank}(t)-C_{tank}(t-\Delta t)}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{A} \left(C_{in}(t) \cdot \frac{Q_{in}(t)}{h(t)} - C_{tank}(t - \Delta t) \cdot \frac{Q_{out}(t)}{h(t)} \right) \\
	
	\Updownarrow \\
	
	C_{tank}(t) = \frac{1}{A} \left(C_{in}(t) \cdot \frac{Q_{in}(t)}{h(t)} - C_{tank}(t - \Delta t) \cdot \frac{Q_{out}(t)}{h(t)} \right) \cdot \Delta t + C_{tank}(t-\Delta t) \\

	\Updownarrow \\

	C_{tank}(t) =  C_{in}(t) \cdot \frac{1}{A} \frac{Q_{in}(t)}{h(t)} \cdot \Delta t -  C_{tank}(t - \Delta t) \cdot \frac{1}{A} \frac{Q_{out}(t)}{h(t)} \cdot \Delta t + C_{tank}(t - \Delta t) \\

	\Updownarrow \\

	C_{tank}(t) =   C_{in}(t) \cdot \frac{1}{A} \frac{Q_{in}(t)}{h(t)} \cdot \Delta t +  C_{tank}(t - \Delta t) \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{1}{A} \frac{Q_{out}(t)}{h(t)} \cdot \Delta t \right)

\end{array}
\end{equation}

To avoid instability or oscillation when the condition $h(t) < Q_{out}\cdot \Delta t / A$ occurs, the concentrate level in the tank should be set equal to the inflow level. This condition corresponds to the fluid being in the tank at one-time step has been emptied out of the tank at the next, meaning that the fluid in the tank at the next time step is new inflow.  

%Again considerations is needed during implementation, such that the level of concentrate in the tank can not exceed the input level of concentrate when fluid height in tank goes toward zero.
