\chapter{Simulation}\label{ch:simulation}
In this chapter, an overview is given of the design process of the simulation environment. Furthermore, the schemes utilized to be able to simulate the nonlinear parts of the sewage flow, with its various concentrations, is explained. Lastly, the designed environment is implemented and verified. It is decided to utilize MATLAB as the platform to be used for this project. Furthermore, it is assumed that readers are familiar with basic terminology related to MATLAB, and therefore specifics will not be given hereof.

In the following, the basic structure of the simulation and the design of it is explained.
