\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}

%In this section the suggested a structure in section \ref{sec:Structure} implemented with the numerical solutions in section \ref{se:preissmann_scheme}-\ref{sec:concentrate}, is tested and verified.
In this section the implementation of the various parts, which the simulation environment consist of, is explained. The chosen structure, which is described in section \ref{sec:Structure}, is seen in figure \ref{fig:Basic_implementation}.

The first part to be elaborated upon is the initialization.

 \subsection*{Initialization}

For the setup procedure of the simulation in list form, the specifications part shown in figure \ref{fig:sys_setup} needs to be defined. The necessary parameters in the list for both pipe and tank can be seen in table \ref{tab:init_list}. 
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{enumerate} 
	\item Pipe
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Length [m]
		\item Sections (Number of sections the pipe should be split in to)
		\item $\text{I}_\text{b}$ (Slope) [\textperthousand]
		\item $\Delta$x = Length/Sections [m]
		\item Diameter [meter]
		\item Theta (parameter used in Preissmann scheme)
		\item $\text{Q}_{\text{f}}$ (maximum flow found by Manning formula, see equation \ref{eq:qf_for_flow}) [$\text{m}^\text{3}/\text{s}$]
		\item Side/lateral inflow present 
		\item Section location in data 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Tank
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Size [$\text{m}^\text{3}$]
		\item Height [m]
		\item Area = Size / Height [$\text{m}^\text{2}$]
		\item Maximum outflow [$\text{m}^\text{3}/\text{s}$]
		\item Section location in data 
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{enumerate}
\caption{List of parameters for pipe and tank}
\label{tab:init_list}
\end{table}
Some parameters can be found from others and is set to be calculated automatically. 
%Furthermore an item is added that indicates in which section of the obtained simulation data the specific output of the component is located. This item is given the number of the order in which the component appears in the list. 
Furthermore an item is added to the list which indicates, where the initial and simulated data, for the specific item can be found.
To give an overview of the system to be simulated, and to easily be able to locate specific parameters needed during simulation, three structures is returned to the workspace. These are named ``pipe\_spec'', ``tank\_spec'' and ``sys\_setup''. The first two structures holds the information shown in table \ref{tab:init_list}\fxnote{svært at se, at listen ovenover er angivet som tabel.} respectively. The last one, ``sys\_setup'', holds information of the various parts indexed in the order the system is setup and simulated. In figure \ref{fig:sys_setup_matlab} the content of ``sys\_setup'' is shown for a setup with two pipes and a tank.

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Display of structure showing system setup information in MATLAB.}
\label{fig:sys_setup_matlab}
\end{figure}

An initialization scheme is constructed as per figure \ref{fig:simple_sewer} where adjoint pipes is considered as one part of the system and each tank is an individual part, which means that tanks is used as a separator between parts consisting of pipes.
The iterative scheme shown in figure \ref{fig:preissmann_grid_scheme_exampel} requires that boundary conditions is found before the iterative Preissmann scheme can be started. It has been decided by the project group that input should be given in flow, as input in height would be needed to be specific for the pipe inserted, to make the simulation universal. This means that from an initial input flow the corresponding height in the pipes needs to be found. By equation \ref{eq:calc_for_flowv2} flow can be obtained from height, but as the the equation is transcendental it can not be solved analytically for height. This means that other means is necessary to obtain height from flow. Various iterative schemes exists to solve such equations, but due to the desire to keep computation time at a minimum, use of such schemes is refrained from.
A solution to the problem is that for each pipe, during initialization, a data set from zero to the diameter of the pipe in sufficient steps is created, and from which the corresponding flow is obtained by equation \ref{eq:calc_for_flowv2}. From this data a curve fitted polynomial can be obtained by the MATLAB curve fitting toolbox or a lookup table can be constructed. Flow data is generated for 10.000 height steps for a pipe with the parameters shown in table \ref{tab:pipe_figure_parameters}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline
Diameter & 0,9 meter \\ \hline
Slope ($\text{I}_\text{b}$) & 3 \textperthousand \\ \hline

Sections & 10 \\ \hline
 \end{tabular} 
\caption{List of parameters used to obtain data shown in figure \ref{fig:curvefit_comparision}}
\label{tab:pipe_figure_parameters}
 \end{table}

In figure \ref{fig:curvefit_comparision} a comparison is shown of the generated data and a ninth order polynomial fitted to the data.

\begin{figure}[H]

 \input{report/simulation/tikz/curvefit_comparison}
\caption{Comparison between data obtained by equation \ref{eq:calc_for_flowv2} and the same data curve fitted to a ninth order polynomial.}
\label{fig:curvefit_comparision}
\end{figure}
The two plots in the figure is seemingly identical, but if observed closer the curve fit has what could be described as a low frequency oscillation compared to the plotted data. Furthermore the curve fit does not reach the same end points. This will result in the height at the end points never to be zero or the diameter of the pipe, when no inflow or maximum inflow is present. In figure \ref{fig:curvefit_comparision_split} the plot is separated into three for an easier overview.


\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}


 As discussed in section \ref{sec:Structure}, a scheme which brings the system to an initial steady state could be necessary due to the nonlinear nature of the Saint-Venant equations. A test is performed where two adjoint pipes, with the specifications given in table \ref{tab:pipe_figure_parameters}, is calculated for different amount of iterations. The boundary condition is found by the fitted polynomial for each pipe respectively. The result of this test is seen in figure \ref{fig:two_pipes_init_steady_state}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \input{report/simulation/tikz/two_pipes_init_steady_state}
\caption{Height and flow in two adjoint pipes, with identical specifications given in table \ref{tab:pipe_figure_parameters}, given boundary conditions found by fitted polynomial, and calculated at various amount of iterations with constant flow input of 0,25 $\text{m}^\text{3}$/s. Dotted line indicate intersection between pipes.}
\label{fig:two_pipes_init_steady_state}
\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:two_pipes_init_steady_state} a maximum of 22 iterations are performed, as the error between the input flow of 0.25 $\text{m}^\text{3}$/s desired to be in all sections and the calculated flow in all the sections of the two pipes is less than $1\cdot10^{-7}$ which is a preset condition. \fxnote{forstår ikke den sidste del af denne sætning}
Some discrepancy in heights can be seen at the start of both pipes. These two points are the boundary conditions that are found by the fitted polynomial. Even though the anomalies are small they could pose a problem when expanding the simulation with more pipes and different slopes. 

In figure \ref{fig:Fredericia_pipe_setup} the specifications of the main line of Fredericia mentioned in section \ref{se:system_description}, and given by table \ref{tab:kloak_diameter} with corrections from table \ref{tab:new_slope_values}, is seen.

\caption{Setup in MATLAB of pipe system from section \ref{se:system_description} of main line in Fredericia.}
\label{fig:Fredericia_pipe_setup}
\end{figure}

The amount of sections for each pipe is chosen such that each section is close to being 20 meters, with some sections deviating due to pipe length and others deviates on purpose to see if it affects the outcome.  
In figure \ref{fig:fredericia_init_steady_state} iterations of the pipe setup shown in figure \ref{fig:Fredericia_pipe_setup} is seen. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\label{fig:fredericia_init_steady_state}
\end{figure}

It is clear that the larger setup increases the undesired behavior seen in figure \ref{fig:two_pipes_init_steady_state}. But it can also be seen that the flow can be brought to an acceptable initial state from which the system can start simulating. In figure \ref{fig:fredericia_init_steady_state_zoom} a section of the height plot from figure \ref{fig:fredericia_init_steady_state} is seen. 
% system needs to be brought in to steady state to negate unintended results when starting simulating.

\end{figure}\fxnote{Forstår ikke figur tekst}

In the above figure, the obtained height from the fitted polynomial is at it worst off by almost a centimeter. But when simulating this offset will only occur in the first section of the pipe. This means that it will be a greater disturbance on short pipes with few sections than larger ones with more sections. An alternative method is attempted to conclude if the deviations of the curve fitted polynomial seen in figure \ref{fig:curvefit_comparision_split} is the cause or if there is an unforeseen error in the Preissmann scheme. A lookup table, where the same data used to create the polynomial, is utilized. A simple implementation is made where the index in the vector of flow is found by subtracting the input flow from the vector. The desired index is then found by searching for the lowest absolute value. Finally the resulting height is given as the desired index of the height vector. The chosen scheme for creating the lookup table means that the height will in worst case be rounded to the nearest step. But indexing the flow and height into the chosen 10.000 steps, it is assumed to be an insignificant error, and in worst case the amount of steps can be increased. In figure \ref{fig:fredericia_init_steady_state_lut} an identical test of the pipe setup of Fredericia is performed at various iterations.      

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \input{report/simulation/tikz/fredericia_init_steady_state_lut}
\caption{Height and flow in pipe setup, given by table \ref{tab:kloak_diameter} with corrections from table \ref{tab:new_slope_values}, of part of Fredericia where boundary conditions is found by lookup table. Various amount of iterations, with constant flow input of 0,25 $\text{m}^\text{3}$/s, is performed. Dotted line indicates pipe intersections.}
\label{fig:fredericia_init_steady_state_lut}
\end{figure}

It is clearly shown that the deviation between the boundary conditions found by the lookup table and the values found by the following iterations of the Preissmann scheme is significantly decreased.
Something else to note is that even though the difference seem to be non existent it still required 189 iterations before the flow error were minimized to the same 1$\cdot \text{10}^{\text{-7}}$ as before. For this reason it is decided to implement the scheme which brings the adjoint pipe parts into steady state before simulation starts. A decisive choice is not made at this point whether the curve fitted polynomial or the lookup table should be implemented. The reason for this is that some imprecision can be accepted if reduction in simulation time can be obtained. A test will therefore be performed, in the simulation part of the implementation, to decided which scheme should be utilized. A flow chart of the initialization scheme, where initial values for the entire setup is found, can be seen in figure \ref{fig:init_sys_dia}.

\begin{figure}[H]

Two functions, namely ``Tank'' and ``Init\_pipe'', is used to obtain the initial values for tanks and the boundary conditions, for the pipes, needed to start iterating with the Preissmann scheme. The tank function returns the initial flow, height and the input needed for the pump, such that inflow is equal to outflow in the tank. Due to MPC requiring constraints for the input to the pump in the tank and due to time constraint of the project, a limitation in the simulation is made. The limitation refers to tanks not being able to be the end point of the entire system setup. The reason for this is that a uniform control input of zero to one for all pumps, to ease constraint setup when utilizing MPC, is obtained. The following parameters is set in the tank function:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Q_{in} = Q_{initial}$ $[m^3/s]$
	\item $Q_{out} = Q_{in}$ $[m^3/s]$
	\item $u_{initial} = Q_{in}/Q_{max-outflow}$ $[\cdot]$
	\item $h = h_{initial}$ $[m]$
	\item $C = C_{initial}$ $[g/m^3]$
\end{itemize}

Where Q is flow, u is pump input, h is height and C is concentrate.
The pipe function is given initial flow, component number from the system setup list in figure \ref{fig:sys_setup_matlab}, the corresponding pipe specifications to the amount of pipes indicated by the system setup list and an error value. The error value is the accepted error between desired flow and the flow obtained by iterating with the Preissmann scheme, which means that when the error is less than the error value the system is in the desired steady state. A flowchart of the pipe function can be seen in figure \ref{fig:init_pipe_chart}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.05 \textwidth]{report/simulation/pictures/init_pipe_chart.pdf}
\caption{Flow chart of pipe initializing function where the blue box is setup of curve fitted polynomial for each pipe, red box is computation of data in pipes and the yellow box calculates desired and average flow for error stop condition.

\label{fig:init_pipe_chart}
\end{figure}\fxnote{pil i rød boks skæv og fra Yes til calculate inout values kan man gå to veje? og hvis jeg skal kunne forsvare den, skal vi nok lige have den gennemgået sammen xD}

The pipe initialization function can be separated into three parts as indicated by the blue, red and yellow stippled boxes. In the blue stippled box the generated data, which can also be used for a lookup table, is used to create the curve fitted polynomial. 
When data are generated for all the pipes given to the function, a flag is set such that unnecessary calculations is not performed further on. In the red stippled box the calculations of the height and concentrate is performed. In the first time iteration ``m = 1'' the initial boundary condition is set for all sections of pipe number ``x''. This corresponds to the i-th row of circles shown in figure \ref{fig:preissmann_grid_scheme_exampel}. Furthermore when iterating through the pipes the corresponding pipe specifications is checked to decide if the pipe has side inflow. If it is present then the inflow into the pipe is a simple summation of input flow and side inflow. The concentrate input in the case of side inflow is found by equation \ref{poop_addition_interconnection}.
%From the inflow and concentrate throughout the pipe is calculated. 
For the next pipe the input is then set to be the output of the previous pipe plus eventual side inflow.%, the same calculation of height and concentrate is then performed again.
At the following time iterations the input boundary condition is found at section ``n = 1''. The Preissmann scheme is then utilized to find the height, and the concentrate is calculated, for the remaining pipe sections. This is done for all the pipes given to the function.
Lastly in the yellow stippled box the desired and average flow values in the pipe or pipes is calculated. At the first time iteration ``m = 1'' the values of ``Flow\_avg'' and ``Flow\_desired'' are not updated. The reason is that the initial flow is inserted as the flow in all sections of all the pipes, which would give an error which are zero and stop the initialization loop. In the following iterations, disregarding the boundary condition which are still calculated, the flow is found from height which can vary for some iterations as seen in figure \ref{fig:fredericia_init_steady_state}. When the flow in all sections of all the pipes has an error which is sufficiently small from the desired flow the iterations is stopped. The flow, height and concentrate data from the latest iteration is returned and the simulation has a steady state point from where it can start. The amount of iterations and the accuracy of the steady state of course depends on the chosen error value. In figure \ref{fig:error_value_test}, the result of various tested error values can be seen.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering
 \input{report/simulation/tikz/error_value_test}
\caption{Various values of error value is tested with lookup table and curve fitted polynomial tested on pipe setup shown in figure \ref{fig:Fredericia_pipe_setup} of Fredericia.}
\label{fig:error_value_test}
\end{figure} 

If the curve fitted polynomial is utilized to obtain boundary conditions then an error value below $1\cdot10^{-6}$ is preferable. But for setup's with more pipes it can be necessary to lower this value even further. The lookup table on the other hand is due to its better precision not considerably affected in the first place, though some precision is obtained by lowering the error value. As the tested error value is performed on a simple test, and final decision has not been made on which scheme to utilize an error value of $1\cdot10^{-9}$ has been decided upon. The reason being the results shown in figure \ref{fig:Fredericia_pipe_setup} \fxnote{rigtige henvisning? virker som resultat henvisning og ikke til pipe spec}, and that various setups where more pipes with different initial flows might yield a worse result.


\subsection*{Simulation}

Having obtained initial data, for which iterating with the Presissmann scheme can begin, the next part to be implemented is the simulation of the initialized setup.
To ease eventual future expansion of the simulation a simple design, where individual parts is simulated one at a time, is chosen. This is realized by nesting functions in two steps from the main simulation module which is seen in figure \ref{fig:simu_main_chart}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7 \textwidth]{report/simulation/pictures/simu_main_chart.pdf}
\caption{Main simulation loop.}
\label{fig:simu_main_chart}
\end{figure}

The amount of iterations desired to simulate the system for is chosen. As the system is already initialized and MATLAB does not have zero indexing the system is initialized at m equal to one. Therefore the first iteration is performed at m equal to two and proceeds until the chosen amount of iterations is reached. The function ``simulation'' is given flow and concentrate input, system specification (Sys\_setup), pipe specification (pipe\_spec). If a tank is present, actuator input and tank specification (tank\_spec) is also needed.
In figure \ref{fig:simu_chart} the simulation function is seen.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9 \textwidth]{report/simulation/pictures/simu_chart.pdf}
\caption{Simulation function.}
\label{fig:simu_chart}
\end{figure}

The simulation function is given input of flow, concentrate and actuator for pipes and tanks respectively. Furthermore specifications of system, pipe and tank is given. The basic functionality is an outer and an inner loop. The outer loop iterates through the parts in ``Sys\_setup'' and the inner loop iterates through the components each part consists of. Iterating through the parts, checking whether the component is a tank or pipe, the respective function is called. The tank function is given tank specifications, current iteration value, flow and actuator input. Furthermore the index number of the tank is given. The iteration value ``m'' is in the function used to index when logging data. Output flow is found by equation \ref{eq:control_signal_pump_tank}. The value of $\overline Q$ is set to be the maximum inflow of the adjoining pipe. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:imp_tank_outflow}
	Q_{out} = u_{pump} \cdot Q_{max\_outflow}
\end{equation} 
Where maximum outflow is equal to maximum inflow of the down stream adjoining pipe.
Doing so makes is possible to always have an actuator input which ranges from zero to one, which helps minimizing complexity when implementing control on large scale setups where several tanks of various sizes could be present. In figure \ref{fig:tank_function} a flow chart of the tank function can be seen.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95 \textwidth]{report/simulation/pictures/tank_function.pdf}
\caption{Tank function.}
\label{fig:tank_function}
\end{figure}

The tank function is given inflow, actuator input, ``Tank\_nr'', tank specification, iteration value ``m'', part index ``x'' and data stored at index ``Sys\_comp''. Iteration and part index is used to fetch previous values of height and concentrate level, used in calculation of new values. Furthermore the value of ``Tank\_nr'' is used as index in ``Tank\_spec''.
First when the height and flow has been calculated, the condition mentioned in section \ref{sec:tank} is checked to avoid oscillating concentrate level in the tank. %Secondly the considerations mentioned in section \ref{sec:tank} is needed when fluid height goes towards zero. 
Secondly, as seen in the flowchart, if the calculated height gives a result below zero the height is set to zero and maximum outflow is set equal to inflow. In the case of concentrate level, if height is less than $\text{Q}_\text{out} \cdot \Delta t / \text{A}$ then the level in the tank is set equal to the inflow level. If the fluid level exceed the height of the tank a message is printed to the command windows which also contains at which iteration the overflow occurred. Instead of placing a hard limit on tank height, knowing when a tank overflow occurs, and how much the dimension of the tank needs to be adjusted, would be more valuable. 
In figure \ref{fig:pipe_function} the pipe function can be seen.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9 \textwidth]{report/simulation/pictures/pipe_function.pdf}
\caption{Pipe function.}
\label{fig:pipe_function}
\end{figure}

The function is given inflow, pipe\_comp, pipe specifications, iteration value ``m'', part index ``x'' and data stored at index ``Sys\_comp''.
Once again iteration and part index is used to fetch previous values of height and concentrate level, used in calculation of new values. The value of pipe\_comp is used as index in ``pipe\_spec''. The functionality of the function is to iterate through the sections which the pipe consists of.
At the first section, n = 1, it is determined if the pipe is the first in the specific part. Afterwards it is checked if side inflow is present. If the pipe is the first then inflow needs to be given, otherwise the flow out of the previous pipe is set as inflow. When inflow is obtained height can be found from either curve fitted polynomial or lookup table as mentioned in the initialization part of the implementation. For the remaining sections in the pipe the the height is found by the Preissmann scheme. Lastly data is returned to the simulation function.\fxnote{Forstod det ikke, men var også træt.}
To decided upon which of the, curve fitted polynomial or lookup table, methods should be implemented a test with the pipe setup shown in figure \ref{fig:Fredericia_pipe_setup} is performed for various iterations. Furthermore two values of $\Delta t$ is tested. A  sinusoidal input is given for all tests to increase the computational power needed to solve the Preissmann scheme. The input can be seen in figure \ref{fig:comparison_look_fit_input}.
\begin{figure}[H]

The results are obtained by using the MATLAB function ``tic-toc'' on the main simulation loop shown in figure \ref{fig:simu_main_chart}. Furthermore a laptop with an I7-4710MQ processor at 3,4 GHz is used for the test. Clearly the lookup table is preferable both in accuracy and computational speed. For this reason it is implemented as the solution to obtain fluid height border\fxnote{boundary?} condition from inflow of the pipe.
