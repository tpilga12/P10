\chapter{Modeling}\label{se:modeling}

The approach for modeling a sewer system with its different components comprising of free flow gravity and pressurized sewer lines, interconnections and reservoirs. This is with the goal of obtaining a model of the main sewer line with the various areas as input disturbances, as shown in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, such that control of the flow and concentrate into the WWTP can be performed.
