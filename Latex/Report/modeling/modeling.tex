\chapter{Modeling}\label{se:modeling}

%The approach for this chapter is to obtain a model of the sewer system with its different components comprising of free flow gravity and pressurized sewer lines, interconnections and reservoirs. 
%This is with the goal of obtaining a model of the main sewer line with the various areas as input disturbances, as seen on figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, such that control of the flow and concentrate into the WWTP can be performed.
This chapter will in detail explain the modeling procedure of the various components comprising the sewer system seen in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}.
In the following, methods to model the components such as flow in gravity and pressurized sewer lines (section \ref{se:hydraulics_of_sewer_line}), interconnections such that disturbances can be added to the main sewer line (section \ref{se:sewer_interconnection}) and tanks in the sewer network (section \ref{se:sewer_reservoir}). Furthermore transport of concentrate in the wastewater flowing in the main sewer line (section \ref{se:transport_of_concentrate}), is modeled.
