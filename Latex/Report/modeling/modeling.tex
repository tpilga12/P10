\chapter{Modeling}\label{se:modeling}

The approach for modeling a sewer system with its different components comprising of free flow gravity and pressurized sewer lines, interconnections and reservoirs. This is with the goal of obtaining a model of the main sewer line with the various areas as input disturbances, as shown in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, such that control of the flow and concentrate into the WWTP can be performed. In the following methods to model the components, such as the flow in gravity and pressurized sewer line, interconnections such that disturbances can be added to the main sewer line and the concentrate of the wastewater flowing in the main sewer line, is examined.
