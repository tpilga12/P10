\section{Hydraulics of sewer pipes}\label{se:hydraulics_of_sewer_pipes}

Methods to model hydraulics of gravity and pressurized sewers is explained respectively in the following. The open channel flow in gravity sewer lines can be described by the Saint-Venant equations which gives an expression for conservation of mass and momentum.
Some assumptions is made when utilizing the Saint-Venant equations:

\begin{enumerate}

\item The flow in the sewer is one-dimensional, meaning that the water height and velocity is uniform in the cross-section and only changes horizontally.
\item The curvature of the sewer line is sufficiently small and vertical accelerations can be neglected such that the pressure can be assumed hydrostatic.
\item The variation of width in the sewer line is small.
\item The slope of the sewer line is small. 

\end{enumerate}
