\section{Sewer interconnection}\label{se:sewer_interconnection}
This section will explain how interconnection between channels are modeled and how the mixing between wastewater and wastewater with chemicals.

In figure \ref{fig:interconnections} an illustration of a interconnection between two flows are shown.

The two channels $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are connected at the end of each channel here the wastewater from the two channels will be added up. The flow $Q_3$ is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
	Q_3 = Q_1 + Q_2 	
\end{equation} 

For dilute chemicals For the mixing between two flows where one of them is transporting chemicals will be done in the same way as for flows. 

\begin{equation}
	C_3 = \frac{C_1 Q_1 + Q_2}{Q_3}
\end{equation}
