\chapter{Control}\label{ch:control}

In this chapter the Model Predictive Control scheme is elaborated upon. To limit the complexity of the MPC scheme, a quadratic cost function is setup. 
Furthermore several tools exist in MATLAB, one of these are Quadprog, which can be used to solve quadratic problems when a linear system is present.  
For that reason it is decided to construct a linearization function which can produce a linear model of the setup of pipes and tanks. 
In the following the procedure to obtain a linearized model from the nonlinear setup is elaborated on.
