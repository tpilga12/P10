% Mixing loops are widely used in large buildings to supply zones with hot or cold water. A zone can represent radiators, in-floor heating, heating or cooling coil, space heating and several other water consumers. These zones have varied demands for flow and temperature. The reason is, that the zones have different individual loads \cite{grundfosweb}.    

% A single mixing loop is used to provide a zone with a certain temperature and flow. It is important that these parameters are controlled so a zone gives the wanted heat output. For example, in a large building, multiple mixing loops are required to heat or cool different parts of the building. The demand in each zone can variate depending on the wanted output or disturbances from the outside could affect a zone e.g. the sun. If the sun is shining on one side of the building the demand in that zone for heat might be lower than the demand for the shady side \cite{brian}. 
  
% Within in these mixing loops, a valve is placed to control how much hot water from the main supply that is needed for the particular zone. Therefore the valve is controlling the temperature. These valves are subject to wear and tear and over time will cause control problems. This problem is called hysteresis and it will deteriorate the control performance by affecting the process output with limit cycles. Which causes the process output to drift around the steady-state value and therefore never reached steady state. The hysteresis comes from backlash and static friction (stiction). Valves with a high level of stiction have the outcome of stick-slip motion which causes the control loop to oscillate. The backlash will add a time delay to the control loop which will also deteriorate the control performance \cite{tore_hagglund}. 

% Even if the problems caused by hysteresis are severe, the operator managing the control plants often does not discover the problem, because he has too many control loops to supervise \cite{tore_hagglund}. If hysteresis is discovered for a control valve and the hysteresis deteriorated the output, the best actions to take are either to replace or repair the valve. Because over time the hysteresis will normally only increase \cite{tore_hagglund}. However, if a valve needs to be replaced or repaired the operation has to be stopped, hence the system will have a downtime and money would be spent on new equipment and labor. This has no interest and therefore a valve should be used for as long as possible and therefore it is of interest to compensate for hysteresis \cite{tore_hagglund}.     

% The hysteresis can be compensated to an extent, by buying expensive equipment which is less affected by stiction and backlash. Hysteresis compensation revivals an alternative solution, and by using a compensation method a less expensive valve could be used such that the cost of the product will be reduced. Therefore the idea for this project is to find a solution that can compensate for hysteresis in a valve. %and thereby an alternative solution could be used.

% \textit{3. Backlash compensation
% When it is discovered that a control valve has got so
% much backlash that the control is deteriorated, the best
% action to take is, of course, to replace or repair the valve.
% The fact that the amount of backlash normally increases
% with time makes this even more important.
% However, to replace or repair a valve means normally
% that the production has to be stopped. For this reason,
% and for the economical reason that it is of interest to use
% a valve for as long time as possible, it is of interest to com-
% pensate for the backlash.}\fxnote{skal skrives ind også det med at en operator i et stort firma ikke har tid til at overvåge alle control loops}
