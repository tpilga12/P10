A sewer system is used for removing wastewater originating from households, industries and runoff from different urban areas. It is collected in the sewers and transported through the sewer network to a wastewater treatment plant, where the wastewater will go through a filtering process and thereafter be discharged into to a receiving water system. The European definition of a sewer network is: \textit{A sewer system is a network of pipelines and ancillary works that convey wastewater from its sources such as a building, roof drainage system, or paved area to the point where it is discharged into a wastewater treatment plant or directly into the adjacent environment (BS EN 752.1, 1996)}\fxnote{find kilden, dette er en citering fra biblen, hvor han refer til BS EN 752.1}. Sewer network consist of pipes (sewer lines) and different installations and structures such as inlets, manholes, drops, shafts and pumps.

Sewer network date back to the beginning of urban settlements. These networks was used to remove either wastewater from houses or surface runoff in populated areas \fxnote{kilde}. Around 2500-2000 BC the settlement of the Indus Valley Civilization, located in the west Pakistan, buildings shows bathing and latrine facilities. Where a sewer system equipped with a grit chamber is used to remove unwanted materials from the water. A grit chamber is a long narrow tank designed to slow the flow and thereby solids such as sand will settle out of the water due to gravity. At the time these grit chambers was important for a proper function of the sewerage.

Up until the seventeenth century most large cities in Europe had underdeveloped drainage infrastructure. Hereafter the development of underground sewer networks started. Paris was one of the first to develop a efficient sewer network. In the period of the French revolution, around 200 years ago, the total length of sewer network in Paris was only 26 km long. This was extended to 600 km in 1887. Which indicate the need of removing wastewater from the growing cities. The reasons for constructing these underground sewers, was to collect the wastewater, due to the malodorous smell from open sewers, cesspools, privies and furthermore, freeing space in the densely packed streets of the populated cities, thereby giving space to roads, housing etc.
