\section{General sewer construction}\label{se:sewer_construction}
This section will elaborate the general construction of a sewer. Furthermore a general explanation for the transport of wastewater undergoes from households/industry to it is treated at the plant will be elaborated.    

In figure \ref{fig:sewer_overview_of_the_different_parts} a block diagram of the process wastewater undergoes is illustrated.

From the left in the figure the precipitation over urban surfaces are collected in the sewer. If the precipitation are to extreme for the sewer to handle it will be discharged in a storm water sewer, which will lead the water into small rivers or be collected in tanks \fxnote{Skriv hvad det bliver brugt til}. Furthermore from the left the water supplies goes into the consumers of the water, such as the industry or households. These will produce wastewater that is lead into the sewers. Within the sewers chemical and microbial reactions occurs, which will be explained in subsection \ref{subse:chemical_reactions_in_a_sewer}. If the sewer is overfilled the wastewater is lead into rivers and fields to prevent flooding in households, industry and urban surfaces. The sewer leads the wastewater to the wastewater treatment plant, where the wastewater will be filtered before sending it back into the environment, which will be explained in greater detail in subsection \ref{subse:Wastewater treatment plant}.
The water treatment plant are constructed near rivers or a fjord which is often at a lower geographical location, thereby enabling the force of gravity to transport the wastewater in a sewer. If the industry or the households are at a lower geographical location than the water treatment plant, then pumps are used to transport the wastewater as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Sewer_drawing}.

These pipes are often constructed in concrete or polyethylene. Where concrete pipes are used for gravity sewers and polyethylene are used in a pressure sewer due to a lower roughness height which means less friction from the surface of the pipe.
