\section{Project focus}
\label{sec:problem_statement}
In this section the focus of this project will be established, based on the previous section.
\\
\\
The focus of this project will be to regulate a system of interconnected pumps, valves and pipes, which could have instability problems when feedback control is used. %problem stated in \ref{sec:pressure_management}. 
The goal is to find a solution for this instability problem, so the system is stable and will be able to keep a certain pressure inside the interconnected PMA's. 
\\

The problem statement has been deducted from previous sections:
\begin{center}
\label{ProblemStatement}
\textit{How can multiple pressure management areas be regulated when these are interconnected and still maintaining a certain water pressure at the critical points?}
\end{center}

In the next chapter, an existing system at Aalborg University will be elaborated and analysed.
