\chapter*{Preface}
This report has been created by Jacob Naundrup Pedersen and Thomas Holm Pilgaard. The project is made on the master thesis of the master in Control and Automation at Aalborg University. 

The report is intended for people with knowledge corresponding to a master student at Control and Automation. MATLAB is used as the primary software tool for this project. Figures are constructed by the group, unless a reference is included in the figure text to the source.  

Units are indicated by square brackets after the parameter has been elaborated e.g. Q is flow $\left[\frac{m^3}{s}\right]$. 

Sources are indicated by [name,year], and can be found in the bibliography list at the given
[name,year].

Data-sheets, raw flow profiles from Fredericia and the simulation model can be found in the Attachment.
