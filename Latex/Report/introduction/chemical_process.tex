\subsection{Chemical reactions in a sewer}\label{subse:chemical_reactions_in_a_sewer}
A wastewater treatment plant receive not only what is discharged into the sewer from the industry and households but also the chemical and microbial reactions that occurs in a sewer. Within these sewers different redox reactions occurs under different conditions, these condition are aerobic, anoxic or anaerobic.    %These processes can affect other parts of the system e.g. some reactions may lead to malodorous substances that will reach the urban atmosphere.
