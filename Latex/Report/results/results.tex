\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}
In this chapter, a simulation of the northern part of Fredericia will be conducted.

The goal of this simulation is to simulate a daily flow in the northern part of Fredericia. For this purpose the simulation environment explained in chapter \ref{ch:simulation} is utilized. The pumping station, illustrated with the blue dot in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, is not included in this simulation, the reason is that it will have a dampening effect on the disturbances from the larger industry and the surrounding urban areas. To generate the disturbances from the residential and industrial areas, shown in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, the flow profiles in appendix \ref{app:flow_profiles} is used. These disturbance models are not simulated in pipes from the various areas into the main sewer line but are directly added into the main sewer line. Therefore the results are expected to have higher peaks, as these models are not attenuated, as they would have been if they were simulated in pipes from the various areas. It has been chosen to only use the disturbance from the brewery and bottling plant, as the data from the refinery weren't available. The disturbances from the brewery and bottling plant are shown in figure \ref{fig:flow_profile_industry}. The pipe specifications for this simulation can be seen in table \ref{tab:pipe_data_nonlinear_linear_testv2}.

The first pipe and the two tanks have been added to the original sewer network shown in figure \ref{fig:sewer_line_diagram}. The first pipe is connected from the larger industrial area to the main sewer line indicated by a black circle in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, where the first tank is placed as well. The reason for placing the tank there is, that it should be able to smoothen the flow of wastewater coming from the larger industry. Furthermore, the pipe is placed, such that the MPC should be able to use the delay for prediction.%, as it would be able to measure the disturbance going into the pipe at the industry, and thereby use it in the predictive model to calculate the most optimal control output to the pump. 
 However, as this is not possible, due to the problems experienced with the MPC controller, as explained in section \ref{se:model_predictive_control}. 

The second tank is placed just before the WWTP with the purpose of smoothening the flow into the WWTP. Due to the lack of a controller the tanks is given a static input during the simulation.
%Furthermore several simulations were conducted to obtain an optimal $\Delta t$ as explained in section \ref{subse:stability_and_precision}. As the pipes are split into different sections and as the average flow height is also different from pipe to pipe, the Courant number varies from pipe to pipe. Thus it is difficult to tune so all pipes have the most optimal Courant number. However, it was found that a $\Delta t = 20$, with the given $\Delta x$ shown in table \ref{tab:pipe_data_nonlinear_linear_testv2} for the various pipes, gave an output, where distortion was visible.


In figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_first} the output of a simulated period of two days can be seen. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{report/results/tikz/simulation_output_first}
\caption{Output of the last pipe into the WWTP.}
\label{fig:simulation_output_first}
\end{figure}  

It is clear that the flow varies to a great extent as is also shown in figure \ref{fig:flow_input_wwtp} from the real measurements from the WWTP at Fredericia. However, these two can not be directly compared, as the data from Fredericia also includes the wastewater from the southern part of the city. However, the simulated data results in a greater variation of flow than the data obtained from Fredericia. This could be due to the pump, as mention previously, that smoothen the flow from the northern part of the city and therefore the variations seen on figure \ref{fig:flow_input_wwtp} from Fredericia is due to disturbance coming from the southern part of the city. By taking the mean of the data in figure \ref{fig:flow_input_wwtp} the WWTP have an inflow of 0,28 $m^3/s$ and doing the same to the data in figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_first} the mean is 0,273 $m^3/s$. 

%As the data from Fredericia are both from the northern and southern part of Fredericia the simulate flow is a bit high compared to that. However, this could be due to the flow profiles from the residential and industrial areas in the simulated results are estimated larger than they should be.     

 As no data were available which could give an indication of the amount of COD the brewery or bottling plant produces
the output of concentrate is set to 0,1 $g/m^3$. As mentioned in the summary of the meeting with Fredericia which can be seen in appendix \ref{app:resume} a person produces approximately 120 COD or 0,2 $g/m^3$ per day. 
Therefore it has been chosen to spread this amount per citizen over an entire day such that it fits the flow pattern shown in figure \ref{fig:flow_profile_thulevej}. In figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_first_concentration} the concentration at the output of the last pipe is shown.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{report/results/tikz/simulation_output_first_concentration}
\caption{Simulation of COD output of the last pipe into the WWTP.}
\label{fig:simulation_output_first_concentration}
\end{figure}  

It is clear that the flow pattern is visible in the concentration output, as it can be seen the COD amount is high in the morning when people prepare for work and low during the night as people are at sleep.  

%It can be concluded that a sewer network can be designed in the simulation model, where flow profiles and concentration can be added to the different parts of the model. Furthermore, is the simulation model able to simulate a flow and a concentration. 

A final test was conducted to investigate what a tank could do to the flow if the tank was large enough to contain the wastewater coming from the city. In this test, the tank before the WWTP was increased to 300 $m^3$ with a height of 5 m and an area of 60 $m^2$.

\begin{figure}[H]

\input{report/results/tikz/simulation_output_second_with_tank}
\caption{Output of the last pipe in to the WWTP, where a tank has been placed in front to smooth the flow into WWTP.}
\label{fig:simulation_output_second}
\end{figure} 
The pump has a constant output of 0,3 $m^3/s$, however, if the tank is empty it will follow the flow from the input of the tank. It can be seen by comparing figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_first} and figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_second} that the top has been reduced and thereby a less fluctuated input to the WWTP is obtained.
