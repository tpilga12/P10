The goal of this simulation is to simulate a daily flow in the northern part of Fredericia, where the disturbance can be seen on the input to the WWTP. To do so the simulation model explained in chapter \ref{ch:simulation} is utilized. The pump station, illustrated with the blue solid circle in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, is not included in this simulation, as it will smooth the flow from that station down to the WWTP, thus there will not be any variation in the flow into the WWTP. To generate the disturbances from the residential and industrial zones, shown in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, the flow profiles in appendix \ref{app:flow_profiles} is used. These disturbance models are not simulated from the zones into the main sewer line but are directly added on the main sewer line, therefore the results are expected to have higher peaks, as these models are not attenuated, as they would have been if they were simulated from the zones. It has been chosen to only use the disturbance from the brewery and bottling plant, as the data from the refinery is not accessible. The disturbance from the brewery and bottling plant is shown in figure \ref{fig:flow_profile_industry}. The pipe specifications for this simulation can be seen in table \ref{tab:pipe_data_nonlinear_linear_testv2}.

The first pipe and the two tanks have been added to the original sewer network shown in figure \ref{fig:sewer_line_diagram}. The first pipe goes from the larger industrial area down to the main sewer line showed with a black circle in figure \ref{fig:kloakgrid_simplified}, where the tank is placed as well. The reason for placing the tank there is, that the idea would have been to smoothen the wastewater coming from the larger industry. Furthermore, the pipe is placed, as the MPC could have used it for prediction, as it would be able to measure the disturbance going into the pipe at the industry, and thereby use it in the predictive model to calculate the most optimal control output to the pump. However, as this is not possible, due to the MPC controller is not able to keep a flow output, where the flow variations are kept to a minimum, and as the prediction horizon is limited due to non-convexity as explained in section \ref{se:model_predictive_control}. The second tank is placed right before WWTP with the purpose of smoothing the flow into the WWTP. However, in this simulation, the tanks will just transfer wastewater from the previous pipe to the pipe after the tank.%, due to the MPC controller is not able to control them optimally. 

Several simulations were conducted to find the must optimal $\Delta t$ as explained in section \ref{subse:stability_and_precision}. As the pipes are split into different sections and as the average flow height is also different from pipe to pipe, the Courant number variates. Thus it is difficult to tune so all pipes have the most optimal Courant number. However, it was found that a $\Delta t = 20$, with the given $\Delta x$ shown in table \ref{tab:pipe_data_nonlinear_linear_testv2}, gave the most realistic outcome, as values lower resulted in an output where distortion was visible.

In figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_first} the output of a simulation across two days are shown. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{report/results/tikz/simulation_output_first}
\caption{Output of the last pipe into the WWTP.}
\label{fig:simulation_output_first}
\end{figure}  

It is clear that flow variates to a great extent as is also shown in figure \ref{fig:flow_input_wwtp} from the WWTP at Fredericia. However, these two can not be directly compared, as the data from Fredericia also includes the wastewater from the southern part of the city. But it can give an indication that the simulation corresponds to what is happening in the reality. However, the simulated data results in a greater variation of flow than the data obtained from Fredericia. This could be due to the pump, as mention previously, that smoothen the flow from the northern part of the city and therefore the variations seen on figure \ref{fig:flow_input_wwtp} from Fredericia is due to disturbance coming from the southern part of the city. By taking the mean of the data in figure \ref{fig:flow_input_wwtp} the WWTP have a inflow at 0,28 $m^3/s$ and doing the same to the data in figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_first} the mean is 0,273 $m^3/s$. As the data from Fredericia are both from the northern and southern part of Fredericia the simulate flow is a bit high compared to that. However, this could be due to the flow profiles from the residential and industrial areas in the simulated results are estimated to be larger than the reality.     


The disturbance coming from the brewery and bottling plant has a concentration on 0,1 $g/m^3$. As no data is given which could give an indication of the amount of COD the brewery is producing this is chosen for this test setup. As mentioned at the meeting with Fredericia seen in appendix \ref{app:resume} a person produce 120 COD or 0,2 $g/m^3$ across a day. Therefore it has been chosen to spread this amount per citizen over an entire day so it fits the flow pattern shown in figure \ref{fig:flow_profile_thulevej}. In figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_first_concentration} the concentration at the output for the last pipe is shown.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{report/results/tikz/simulation_output_first_concentration}
\caption{Simulation of COD output of the last pipe into the WWTP.}
\label{fig:simulation_output_first_concentration}
\end{figure}  

It is clear that the flow pattern is visible in the concentration output, as it can be seen that the COD amount is high at the morning when people prepares for work and low during the night as people are sleeping and therefore not producing any COD to the WWTP.  

%It can be concluded that a sewer network can be designed in the simulation model, where flow profiles and concentration can be added to the different parts of the model. Furthermore, is the simulation model able to simulate a flow and a concentration. 

A final test was conducted to investigate what a tank could do to the flow if the tank was large enough to contain the wastewater coming from the city. In this test the tank before the WWTP was increase to 300 $m^3$ with a height of 5 m and a area of 60 $m^2$.

\begin{figure}[H]

\input{report/results/tikz/simulation_output_second_with_tank}
\caption{Output of the last pipe in to the WWTP, where a tank has been placed in front to smooth the flow into WWTP.}
\label{fig:simulation_output_second}
\end{figure} 
The pump has a constant output of 0,3 $m^3/s$, however if the tank is empty it will follow the flow from the input of the tank. It can be seen by comparing figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_first} and figure \ref{fig:simulation_output_second} that the top has been reduced and thereby a less fluctuated input to the WWTP is obtained.
