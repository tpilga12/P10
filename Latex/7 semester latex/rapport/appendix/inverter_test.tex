\section{Combined genset and inverter}
\label{app:combined_genset_and_inverter}
\subsection*{Purpose:}
The purpose of this journal is to test how the genset react when the inverter is carrying the majority of the load. 

\subsection*{Equipment}

		\end{itemize}
		\item Interface (datasheet is found under the path \path{CD:dSPACE/interface}).
\end{itemize}	


\subsection*{Procedure:}

\begin{itemize}
	%\item To setup this test either Jesper Viese Knudsen or Kjeld K. Madsen needs to attend.  
	\item The interface needs to be setup with the genset. CANbus, analog readings and frequency measurement.  
	\item The Hioki scope connected to the genset.
	\item Connect computer.
	\item Load CA7\_full\_system into simulink on the computer \path{CD:simulink/CA7/CA7_full_system}.
	\item Load build\_script into matlab \path{CD:simulink/CA7/build_script}. 
	\item Compile the build\_script.
	\item Open ControlDesk.
	\item Open project CA7 inside ControlDesk.
	\item Press 'Go Online' and 'start measuring' inside ControlDesk. 
	\item Set the needed measuring time for the Hioki scope.
	\item Turn on DC power supply for inverter.
	\item Turn on Inverter.  
	\item Start Genset.
	\item Put 10 kW load on the genset.
	\item Slowly ramp the inverter up to 10 kW. 
	\item Save the data from the Hioki scope on a USB stick or transfer the data through a LAN cable to a PC.

\subsection*{Measurement data:}

\input{rapport/Tikz/test10powerfreqvolt1.tex}
\caption{Plot of frequency, voltage and power.}
\label{fig:test10powerfreqvolt}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Results:}
\figref{fig:test10powerfreqvolt} illustrates how the genset reacts in frequency, voltage and power when the inverter is ramping up to approximately 9 kW of power. From the power plot it can be seen around 70 and 135 seconds that there are some instability. For a brief moment it seems like the inverter falls out. To investigate why this happens some measurements for the inverter is needed. 

The majority of the time the genset is able to handle that the inverter is carrying the load. 

\subsection*{Conclusion}
The genset is able to handle that the inverter is carrying the majority of the load. There are two fall outs to investigate why it happens measurements from the inverter is needed.
