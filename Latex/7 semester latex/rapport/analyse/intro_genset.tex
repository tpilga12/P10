% \section{Diesel Generator}
% \label{diesel_generator}
% This section will contain an introduction to the diesel generator and the transfer function (TF) for the genset.

% Gensets are used to supply electrical power when needed, which could be during power plant breakdowns, if the power grid fails or as support to a power plant. The gensets are also used in isolated places where there is no grid. There they will deliver the frequency and voltage to a non-stiff grid, this is also called island mode. A genset is a system which is a combination of a diesel engine and an electric generator which will convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Gensets consist of several subsystem as engine, generator, governor and the AVR \cite{genset_how_it_works}. These subsystems can be seen in \figref{fig:genset_blockdiagram}.

% The diesel engine is the source of mechanical energy input to the generator. It will deliver a pre-set amount of rounds per minute (RPM) which will be controlled by the governor. When the RPM decreases, which will happen when there is an increase in load, the governor will adjust for the disturbance and inject more fuel into the engine to deliver more mechanical power into the electric generator and vice versa when the load decreases. The electric generator consist of an alternator which is producing the electrical power when it is rotated by the diesel engine \cite{genset_how_it_works}.

% The alternator consist of two parts the stator and the rotor. The stator is the stationary component which is fixed inside the alternators shell and the rotor will (when rotated within the stator) produce a magnetic field which will lead to a current in the windings of the stator \cite{genset_how_it_works}. The alternating voltage regulator (AVR) will regulate the voltage of the generator to a pre-set value. 

% In \secref{modelling_diesel_generator} a TF for a genset will be derived.
